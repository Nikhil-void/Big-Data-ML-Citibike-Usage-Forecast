# CitiBike Usage forcast based on weather - A Big Data Analysis Project on GCP

This project leverages PySpark to process and analyze Citibike user data, compressing 40GB of raw data into a usable format. We enriched our dataset with weather data from open-source databases and then utilized PySpark's machine learning library to create a regression model. This model predicts the estimated usage count of Citibike stations based on various factors, including weather conditions, day of the week, and more.

## Key Highlights

* Scalability: Managed and executed the project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Dataproc for handling large datasets and computations.

* Large Dataset: Our final dataset comprised millions of records, showcasing the scalability and performance of our solution.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Platform:** Google Cloud - DataProc

**Modules:** PySpark, MLlib, SQL
